<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Yvette Peraza and i am attending Cerrtios College to get my associates in Network Systems Administrator. 
    Something fun about me is that i like go to rap shows on my free time. Music is a huge part of me, I started listening to rap at a very young age and it has stuck with me as i was growing up. 
    I mostly like to listen to underground rap and I also collecting vinyls of certain albums. Growing up I actually wanted to become a producer because
    the beat in a song is what i like the most. A favorite producer of mine is The Alchemist and Dr.Dre. Listening to their beats inspire me to make music
    but I still have to come around that and actually do so. </p>
