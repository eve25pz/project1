<h1>Yvette Peraza</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Yvette Peraza and I am attending Cerrtios College to get my associates in Network Systems Administrator. 
    Something fun about me is that I like go to rap shows on my free time. Music is a huge part of me, I started listening to rap at a very young age and it has stuck with me as i was growing up. 
    I mostly like to listen to underground rap and I also collecting vinyls of certain albums. Growing up I actually wanted to become a producer because
    the beat in a song is what I like the most. A favorite producer of mine is The Alchemist and Dr.Dre. Listening to their beats inspire me to make music
    but I still have to come around that and actually do so. </p>
  

    <h1> When I have free time</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I like to go to record stores</li>
        <li>Shoe shopping because i collect sneakers</li>
        <li>Go to the beach at night</li>
    </ol>
    
   

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://sneakernews.com/">Sneakernews.com</a> because it tells me what shoes are coming out!</p>
